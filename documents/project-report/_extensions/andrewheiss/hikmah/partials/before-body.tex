In spring 2023 we reached out to EventSafety A/S regarding the possibility of a collaboration with them regarding our final project.
The idea was a crowd management system using Aritifical intelligence and computer vision to help improve crowd safety management.
Following an agreement to collaborate and various festival invitations by EventSafety to collect data,
a problem statement was produced: \textit{Can computer vision software and AI techniques be leveraged to improve crowd overview for security guards,
by receiving video feed from large crowds, and ultimately improve crowd safety?}
Following this, research was conducted into existing crowd counting methods and their papers leading to the usage of the SASNet crowd counting deep learning model.
The project followed a simple use of scrum with small discussion each morning about the day before and the day ahead.
Throughout the project, several meetings with predefined dates were held with EventSafety to showcase progress and gather feedback for further development
